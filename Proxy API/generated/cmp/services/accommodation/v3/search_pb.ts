// ## Accommodation Services
//
// The Accommodation services are used for both hotels and holiday homes, often
// called short term rentals.
//
// Any search message response in the Camino Messenger Protocol only includes
// dynamic data. Static data can be cached and kept up to data with the Product List
// and Product Details messages.
//
// This package is a **WIP**.

/**
 * The `Accommodation Search Request` message type facilitates the request for
 * accommodations like hotel and holiday home searches within the platform. In the
 * request the market, language and currency are specified at the top-level.
 * 
 * In "queries" we specify the details of the trip like dates, properties or
 * locations or filters. The purpose of such a structure is to allow for multi-room
 * and multi-property search requests.
 * 
 * For the response this means that there is no grouping of different
 * room, mealplan or rateplan options in single room or single property searches.
 * Each AccommodationSearchResult is one bookable option as a "result_id".
 * 
 * Simple example:
 * a search for 1 room for 2 adults would be just 1 query, with one travel period and
 * one set of search parameters. The response has one query_id with many result_ids
 * for various rooms, mealplans and rateplans in one hotel and depending on the search
 * parameters, again for other hotels. Each property+room+rateplan+mealplan is one
 * result_id with just one unit.
 * 
 * The simple example is also applicable for holiday homes where one or multiple
 * result_ids will be returned for various homes matching the query. The results will
 * probably not include a mealplan and in general no room information as all rooms in
 * the home are included. Flexible and non-refundable as well as packaging rateplans
 * are already surfacing in some distribution channels.
 * 
 * Multi room example:
 * a search for 1 room for 2 adults in one query and another room for two adults and a
 * child of 8 in another room in the same hotel or destination for the same dates in
 * another query in the search request. This will lead to a search response with just
 * one unit for eavery possible option available for each query_id, with many result_ids.
 * 
 * The same concept is valid for multiple homes for more than one family travelling
 * together to one park or destination.
 * 
 * Road-trip or circuit example:
 * a search for one or multiple rooms or homes in queries that have sequential dates
 * and destinations. For example a trip to Las Vegas, a flight to New York and decending
 * the atlantic coastline to New Orleans or Orlando by car with stops in various places.
 * 
 * The hostel, convention or groups example:
 * Often just 5 rooms for 10 peopleare requested or specific bed combinations like 5
 * single-use rooms (for 5 travellers) and 5 double rooms (10 travellers) are requested.
 * In this case the number of rooms is specified and the total amount of travellers,
 * but no distribution of travellers per room is detailed in the request. The reponse
 * then hold multiple units for one search_id and result_id, so that if 5 rooms are
 * requested, but only 2 standard rooms are available, the requested amount can be
 * completed with a different room type (superior, seaview,..)
 * 
 * In general, the number of available rooms should be considered to ensure that for
 * requests with multiple rooms or homes, the same room or home is not offered twice
 * to different travellers.
