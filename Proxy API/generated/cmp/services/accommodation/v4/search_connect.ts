// ## Accommodation Services
//
// The Accommodation services are used for both hotels and holiday homes, often
// called short term rentals.
//
// Just like any search message response in the Camino Messenger Protocol, the
// "AccommodationSearch" only includes dynamic data. Static data can be cached
// and kept up to data with the Product List and Product Details messages.
//
// The Accommodation service also has the "ShortList" service, which only returns
// the supplier codes. It can be used without the "modified_after" parameter to
// obtain a full list of all codes for a specific supplier, but the intention is
// usage with the "modified_after" set, to refresh updated products and create a
// list of new and discontinued products.
//
// The workflow to onboard and update properties is as follows:
// * The list of new/updated properties is received via the ShortList request.
// * The products which are not yet mapped by the distributor can be obtained via
//   the ProductList request.
// * The products which are already mapped and needs to be updated in the
//   distributor system shall be requested via the ProductInfo request
//
// The more extensive Accommodation Product List is meant to include all details
// required to map a new property with more details like location, rating, to
// which chain it belongs, address, airports, etc.
// This is being used to decide whether or not this product shall become a
// property sold by the distributor.
//
// Both the "ShortList" and the "ProductList" service contain a status field
// with either "activated" or "deactivated" values, so that Distributors can
// take the properties that are no longer supplied, off-sale for the specific
// Supplier.
//
// Once we have mapped the property we need to download all details. Multiple
// languages can be specified. In case a Distributor requests an unsupported
// language in the request, the supplier should not include that language and
// include a warning in the response. I.e: a Distributor specifies EN, DE, FR
// and NL, the supplier does not support NL and includes descriptions in EN, DE
// and FR, and adding a warning that "NL" is not supported.
//
// Finally, the purchase process that is the same for all message types, can be
// initiated: (Accommodation)Search, Validate, Mint and Cancel.
