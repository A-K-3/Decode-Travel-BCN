/**
 * Accommodation product info service definition
 * 
 * This type of information is typically called static data and is not expected
 * to change frequently.
 * Usually the distributor requests this information in advance to get all the
 * necessary information about products they have already decided to take into
 * account for selling and store them in an inventory system.
 * Often the same property can be delivered from multiple suppliers and content
 * needs to be consolidated, which is not a real-time process.
 * Requesting this on-demand after receiving search results would result in a
 * more complex and potentially slower process, as the distributor would need
 * to gather all the necessary information at that time.
