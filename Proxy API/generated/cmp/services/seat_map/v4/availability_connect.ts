// ## SeatMap and SeatMapAvailability Services
//
// The SeatMap and SeatMapAvailability services are used to manage and retrieve
// seat map information and availability for various products, such as flights,
// trains, cruises and venues for activities like an opera, a concert or a sports
// event.
//
// ### SeatMap general information
//
// For smaller applications, such as an airplane, a small concert hall, or an
// intimate venue, a single, detailed SeatMap is often the most practical choice.
// In these cases, the entire seating arrangement can be presented clearly in one
// view without overwhelming the user.
// A unified map allows passengers or attendees to see exactly where their seat is
// in relation to entrances, aisles, or the focal point—whether that’s a stage, a
// screen, or the plane’s layout. Sections can still be used for example for business
// class or economy class, but the overall map remains relatively small and easy to
// process.
//
// In larger settings like stadiums or convention centers, however, a single
// detailed map can become overly dense and hard to process due to sheer size.
// That’s where multiple smaller SeatMaps, grouped by key areas, categories or
// products, can prove more effective.
//
// By focusing each map on specific zones—such as VIP, general admission, or
// seating blocks can more quickly filter down to the type of product they’re
// seeking.
//
// Still, both strategies have their strengths and trade-offs, which is why a
// hybrid approach often offers the best balance.
// This model starts with a single high-level map that shows the full venue at a
// glance, then allows users to zoom into specific sections for finer detail,
// using a different seat map, instead of drilling down into a subsection of a
// single seat map.
//
// ### SeatMap Service
//
// The SeatMap service is meant to be used as a static data service in combination
// with the SeatMapID of a product. Multiple SeatMaps can be linked to one
// product as a one specific flight might be operated with different planes on
// different days. However, a SeatMapID in a search result can only be one as the
// bookable option is one specific product such as a first class coupe in a train,
// or the VIP area of a concert.
//
// The SeatMap is stored in the distribution system and downloaded only once from
// the supplier for a multitude of displays on the distribution side.
//
// The SeatMapRequest requires a SeatMapID, which should be provided in the ProductInfo
// message for each product and should be downloaded once the product is firstly
// taken on-sale or when the product description id updated. It is multilingual for
// the seat amenities and features.
//
// A section can contain features and amenities, valid for all seats in that section.
// And a section holds either a SeatMapList detailing all seats or just a count of
// "seats", often used for unallocated sections like a standing area at a concert.
// Sections can be nested as many times as required and each section has its own image.
//
// ### SeatMapAvailability Service
//
// The SeatMapAvailability service is used to retrieve the availability of seats based
// on either the Search result_id or the Mint ID. This indicates a specific product for
// a specific date and time, such as a flight or a concert. Conclusively the supplier
// knows what SeatMapID to use and the availability of each seat (in case of a section
// with a SeatMapList) or how many seats are available in an unallocated section.
//
// For allocated sections, the SeatMapAvailability service returns a list of all
// available seats. Missing seats are already booked or reserved.
// The SeatMapAvailabilityResponse also allows nested sections, which can be used in
// case multiple sub sections each have their own SeatMapList.
