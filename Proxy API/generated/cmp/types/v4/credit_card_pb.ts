/**
 * Represents credit card details.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
 * Handling and storing credit card information is subject to strict security
 * standards like PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).
 * Ensure your system complies with all applicable regulations.
 * - The full card number (PAN) should be protected when stored (e.g., using
 *   strong encryption, tokenization).
 * - The CVC (Card Verification Code) **MUST NEVER BE STORED** after transaction
 *   authorization.

   * It is stored as a string to:
   *   1. Preserve leading zeros, which some card numbers might have.
   *   2. Ensure a normalized format without spaces or dashes. For example,
   *      a card number like "1234-5678-9876-5432" should be stored as
   *      "1234567898765432" in this field.
   * 
   * The validation pattern `^[0-9]{12,19}$` enforces that the number consists
   * of 12 to 19 digits, covering the typical length range for major card brands.
   * Application-level Luhn algorithm validation is recommended for enhanced
   * data integrity.

   * 
   * When populating this field:
   *   - The `year` and `month` should correspond to the card's expiration.
   *   - The `day` component can be set to the last day of the expiration month
   *     or a fixed conventional day (e.g., the 1st), as the exact day is
   *     usually not printed on cards and not used in validation.
   *
