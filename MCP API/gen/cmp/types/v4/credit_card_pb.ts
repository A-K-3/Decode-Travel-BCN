 * Handling and storing credit card information is subject to strict security

 * Ensure your system complies with all applicable regulations.
 * - The full card number (PAN) should be protected when stored (e.g., using
 *   strong encryption, tokenization).
 * - The CVC (Card Verification Code) **MUST NEVER BE STORED** after transaction
 *   authorization.

   *
