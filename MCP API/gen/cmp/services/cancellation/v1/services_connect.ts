// ## Cancellation Services
//
// The Cancellation services are used for any message type or vertical.
// There is an imperative workflow, which has the purpose to register the
// cancellation request moment, followed by both parties agreeing the cancellation
// is possible and the refund amount on the blockchain, so that there will be no
// disputes after a cancellation is executed.
//
// There is a detailed explanation on [Camino Docs](https://docs.camino.network/camino-messenger/cancellation)
