// ## Accommodation Services
//
// The Accommodation services are used for both hotels and holiday homes, often
// called short term rentals.
//
// Any search message response in the Camino Messenger Protocol only includes
// dynamic data. Static data can be cached and kept up to data with the Product List
// and Product Details messages.
//
// This package is a **WIP**.
