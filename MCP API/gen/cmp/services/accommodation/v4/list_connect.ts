/**
 * Accommodation product list service definition.
 *
 * This type of information is typically called static data and is not expected
 * to change frequently.
 * The intention of the list is to provide a quick overview of all available
 * accommodation products without the need for detailed information retrieval.
 * This is particularly useful for distributors who want to get a sense of the
 * available inventory at a glance for deciding whether they want to use this
 * property at all. The AccommodationProductList provides more information than
 * the AccommodationProductShortList to identify and map the property. If the
 * property is approved, then it makes sense to get further information with the
 * AccommodationProductInfoService.
