// ### Activity Services
//
// The Activity services are used for both tickets and excursions.
//
// Any search message response in the Camino Messenger Protocol only includes
// dynamic data in the search, validate and mint process. Static data can be cached
// and kept up to date with the Product List and Product Details messages.
//
// Partners keep the list of activity products up-to-date on a daily basis, by
// getting changes since yesterday with the ActivityProductList service. The details
// of the updated activities are bing pulled using the ActivityProductInfo service.
//
// Once we have a traveller interested in an activity, the ActivitySearch service is
// used to obtain the pricing of relevant activities that are available. In this
// process there is no repeated exchange of static data to reduce the message size,
// reduce cost and increase processing speed.
//
// Similar to all other message types, the Activity service is constructed using the
// "Product", "Unit" and "Service" layers. For example the product is a Taylor Swift
// concert or a Disney World ticket. The unit then gives us a choice of the
// different options that are available, like for example a normal ticket or a VIP
// ticket. Finally we would have the services, which can be selected like do we go
// there by ourselves or is a transfer from our hotel included. This then would
// result to product=Disneyland, unit=VIP, service=TRFIncluded.
//
// It is of course impossible to offer a transfer from every hotel in Florida to
// Disney World. A supplier might have defined just the ticket, without transfer. And
// additionally a ticket with transfer from the 25 most popular hotels in the area.
// If the PickUp is not provided in the search request, the response should include
// an option without transfer and further options that include a transfer from
// several hotels that are close together and would cost the same for the ticket and
// transfer.
//
// The Activity search messages will be adapted to work with the SeatMap services,
// just like the Transport service. This package is **WIP**.
