// ## InsuranceServices
//
// Insurance Services has two main processes:
//
// - selling insurances: this process follows the same flow as selling any travel
// product on the Camino Network: Static data download using the InsuranceProductList
// message to obtain the (changed) portfolio of product a supplier offers, followed by
// the InsuranceProductInfo message to get the exact detail of each product. The real-time data
// does not contain any static information and consists of the InsuranceSearch message, followed
// by the generic Validate and Mint messages.
//
// - making an insurance claim: this is a special workflow, only used in the Insurance Services.
// A claim form is requested based on the insurance policy purchased. This "template" is then
// filled with the required information, the necessary documents are attached, and the claim is
// submitted to the supplier. The supplier pushes a status upon change to the distributor.
// It might be possible that further information is required or that an off-line conversation is taking place.
// This finally leads to an acceptance and pay-out or a denial.
